# To-do-list-assignment
A simple and interactive **Task List (To-Do List)** web app that allows users to add, manage, and remove daily tasks efficiently.

## Tests to be made/ Planned functionality:
- ### Creation of Lists with:
    - List names
    - A method of differentiating a list through different colours/icons.

- ### Creation of tasks with:
    -  Reminders
    - Due Dates
    - Choice to repeat
    -  An optinal note for each task.


## Languages used:
- HTML for structuring the web page.
- CSS for styling the page.
- Javascript for list and task functionality.

Disclaimer: Aside from creating objects and constructors, I used AI to create an algorithm for handling tasks and lists.

## Other ideas.
- Custom priority levels for each task.
- Due dates with a time.
